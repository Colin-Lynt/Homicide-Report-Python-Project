# Homicide Analysis Report (Python)

## About
The objective of this achivement was to select your own data to analyze, with the goal of conducting an exploratory visual analysis in pyhton and finding connections between variables that seem worth exploring. After developing my hypotheses, I'll use various advanced analytical approaches to help me test my hypotheses.

## Key Questions
- Which States have the highest reported homicides documented?
- What are the percentages for Age, Race, and Sex when it comes to homicide in the US?
- What is the relationship status between Victim and Offender? Is there a correlation between family and higher homicide?
- Does year and month play a role in homicide cases? Is there an increase and decrease in homicide cases in a specific time of year?
- What is the difference between solved and unsolved cases? Has there been a change over the years?
- Is there a specific region within the US that has more unsolved homicide cases?

## Context:
Established in 2015, the Murder Accountability Project or MAP is a nonprofit group based in Alexandria, VA. Majority of its members have extensive experience when it comes to homicide investigations, as the project includes veteran homicide investigators, investigative journalists and homicide scholars. The project is intended to spread information about homicides, especially unsolved killings and serial murders committed in the United States. Given the context of the work and where the data comes from the MAP is a reliable and creditable source.

## Data Collection:
The MAP gives police and the general public easy-to-use access to two datasets maintained by the FBI. The Uniform Crime Report from 1965 to the present and the Supplemental Homicide Report from 1976 to the present. These are voluntary reporting systems, meaning local police isnâ€™t required to provide any information to the FBI. However, the MAP has determined that UCR data is more than 95 percent complete and the SHR is more than 93 percent complete.

The MAP uses the Freedom of Information Act to obtain its data from justice departments around the U.S. regarding crimes related to homicide. Currently the MAP has obtained data on more than 28,000 homicides that were not reported to the justice department. This means the MAP has the most complete data sets on U.S. homicides available anywhere.

## Content:
This project will be working with the Supplemental homicide Report and contains information regarding the state, the city, the agency, the year, the month, the action type, the type of homicide, the situation, everything relating to the victim and offender (age, sex, race, & ethnicity), the weapon used, and the relationship between the victim and offender.

## Tools
For this project, the following python libraries were used:

- Pandas: For Data Analysis
- Seaborn: For Visualization
- Matplotlib: For Plotting and Visualization
- Scikit-learn: For regression and clustering Algorithms (ML)
